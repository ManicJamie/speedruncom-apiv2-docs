# WARNING

I am unsure what exactly defines the nextjs urls. For all I know, they may be session dependent, may get updated on site compilation, etc. I am temporarily documenting some urls here to see if they work later.

## User Profile
https://www.speedrun.com/_next/data/cQR_bXIOWxgyIQ8Tq9iWp/en-US/users/USERNAME.json?url=USERNAME

The data value here does not appear to change. Extremely useful if persistent, as it contains userSocialConnectionList, finally giving a way to get discord username without scraping! If this isn't persistent, though, it is just as unstable as scraping.
